vim-ondemandhightlight
=========


Highlight a word from inside vim. The color is chosen at random but
persisted across sessions.

VIM defaults for myself

## Installation

Recommendation: Use [pathogen.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen). It
makes life easy. I was a doubter but now believe in it.

Once pathogen is setup, simply run these commands:

```
git clone git://github.com/epage/vim-ondemandhightlight.git ~/.vim/bundle/vim-ondemandhightlight
```

Note: this does not yet work on Windows
